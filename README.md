# Project Name: ReactorFormer

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains the implementation of **ReactorFormer**, a research software developed for multiphysics modeling of chemical reactors. This project is designed to comply with the Nature Research software submission requirements.

## 🔧 System Requirements

- Operating System: Linux / macOS / Windows 10+
- Python ≥ 3.8
- Recommended: Anaconda or virtualenv
- Dependencies (see `requirements.txt`), including:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - torch
  - etc.

## 💻 Installation Guide

### Option 1: Install with pip
```bash
git clone https://github.com/changhepse/ReactorFormer.git
cd ReactorFormer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Create a Conda environment
```bash
conda create -n reactorformer-env python=3.8
conda activate reactorformer-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Demo

We provide a quick demo to run the main program:

```bash
python run_example.py
```

This will load example data, run the model, and save results to the `results/` directory.

## 📘 Instructions for Use

### Input Data Format:
- See `data/README.md` for more information.
- Includes: input parameters (CSV or JSON), model configuration files, ground truth labels, etc.

### Run Main Program:
```bash
python main.py --config configs/base.yaml
```

Modify `configs/base.yaml` to change model architecture, number of training epochs, learning rate, and other settings.

### Reproduce Results:
To reproduce the results in the manuscript:
```bash
bash scripts/reproduce_results.sh
```
